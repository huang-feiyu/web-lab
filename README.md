# Web.Lab

> MIT 6.148: [web.lab](https://weblab.mit.edu/) teaches fundamentals of web
> development, both frontend and backend. (Somewhat easy to learn)

Now that the class isn't a hard-core class, I won't record everything here.
My purpose is to build up my blog site on my own, in which the backend part isn't
very important, but I will try to do that.
